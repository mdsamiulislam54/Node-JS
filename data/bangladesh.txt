Bangladesh is a beautiful country in South Asia known for its rivers, green landscapes, and rich culture. People here are warm, friendly, and respectful toward guests. Bengali is the main language, and we take great pride in our traditions, music, and festivals—especially Pohela Boishakh and Ekushey February. Bangladesh has incredible natural beauty like the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the world’s longest sea beach at Cox’s Bazar. From delicious foods like biryani, pitha, and hilsa fish to the hardworking spirit of its people, Bangladesh is a country filled with energy, talent, and creativity.
